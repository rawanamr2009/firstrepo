        <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
       
        <ul>
            <li>Programming is writing computer code to create a program, to solve a problem.</li>
            <li>Programs are created to implement algorithms .</li>
            <li>Algorithms can be represented as pseudocode or a flowchart ,
             and programming is the translation of these into a computer program.</li>
            <li>To tell a computer to do something, a program must be written to tell it exactly 
             what to do and how to do it. If an algorithm has been designed,
             the computer program will follow this algorithm, step-by-step, which will tell the
             computer exactly what it should do.</li>
        </ul>
