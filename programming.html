        <h2>Programming Languages?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> A programming language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers.
                 Programming languages consist of a set of rules that allows string values to be converted into
                  various ways of generating machine code, or,
                 in the case of visual programming languages, graphical elements.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, a program is a set of instructions written in a particular language 
              <b>  (C, C++, Java, Python)</b> to achieve a particular task.</li>
            <li> Learn more about the top trending and in-demand programming 
                languages and take a step towards upskilling today!</li>

        <h2>Scripting Languages :</h2>
        <p>Simple to learn with easy syntax and dynamic typing, the scripting language is the type of language 
            that is interpreted rather than compiled. The two types of this language are server-side scripting 
            languages and client-side scripting languages.
             These languages make communication possible with other programming languages.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>python</b> - The easiest programming language used among developers is Python.
                 It is an object-oriented programming language. The language has a high-Level data structure,
                 and built-in libraries, that make it easy to use and suitable for rapid application development.
                 It is easy, decoded and has a dynamic semantic language. </li>
            <li><b>perl</b> - The language is dynamic with innovative features that make it popular and different
                 from what is available on Linux and Windows Server. Websites with high traffic usually use Perl,
                  including IMDB,
                 as it helps in text manipulation tasks. </li>
            <li><b>bash</b> - Bourne -Again, SHell is a scripting language that is the default command interpreter 
                on most Linux/GNU operating systems. This language is easier than most of the other programming
                languages. Bash makes it easier to 
                create script store documentation for others and provides useful reusable scripts. </li>
